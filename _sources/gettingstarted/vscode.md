# 1b. Visual Studio Code

> Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a popular interface for programming. 

We're going to use VSCode because that's what everyone uses.

Once you have installed VSCode, open it up and we have a few things we'll need to do immediately.

## 1. Install Python for VSCode Extension

First, we'll want to install the Python extension for VSCode, which can be done via the **extensions** tab on the left. Search up "Python" once prompted in the top-left window, and download the Python extension.

## 2. Select a Directory and Create a File

We'll then want to choose a **directory** (i.e. a folder) to do your coding in. Feel free to pick anything - this can be done by going back to the **Explorer** tab (top-most-left), then either following the prompt in the left window, or the prompt in the middle of the screen.

**Create a new file** by pressing the new file icon next to the folder's name or right click on the empty left panel, then name your file and **end the filename with .py** to tell the computer that you are making a Python file.

You'll also want to open up your terminal by clicking the button on the top-right of your screen that looks like an eraser pointing downwards.

## 3. Using VSCode

To do stuff in VSCode, you type in code on your document, then click the **Run** button on the top right of your screen (it looks like a play button, â–¶). We'll learn what we can do with Python in a sec.

## 4. Setting Up a Virtual Environment

> **(Recommended)** This is optional but is generally considered good practice.

We'll want to set up a **"virtual environment" (venv)** to conduct your code in. In short, this will make it so that all the code you use is self-contained in the specific project you are engaged in, and is useful in keeping your computer organised and sharing your projects with others. To do this, you will need to:
1. Click the big search bar on the top of the screen
2. Select **"Show and Run Commands"**
3. Type in *"Python: Create Environment"*
4. Then click the option that shows up
5. Click "Venv" 
6. Select the latest version of Python available to you

## VSCode Tips 

``` {admonition} Handy Shortcuts

VSCode offers some features that make working with code a lot easier. You'll forget the hotkeys but at least you'll know these are possible:

* To select **multiple instances of the same chunks of code or text** (you'll notice when you highlight some code and theres the same code elsewhere on the screen), press ``Ctrl + D`` on Windows or ``Command + D`` on Mac.


* To **add another cursor**, click while holding ``Alt`` on Windows or ``Command`` on Mac.


* To select **multiple lines**, ``Ctrl + Alt`` + Arrow keys on Windows, ``Option + Command`` + Arrow keys on Mac.
